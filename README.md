### My Learning Objectives
- Assess Unity3D as professional development enviroment
- Understanding how Microsoft, specifically Unity are position in emerging AI, cognitive computing market
- Mentor and expose NLA on some basic programming (e.g., C#) in relation to what he is already doing with Java but aligned with his interests in games and things "visual".

### Key Takeaways
- Unity is evangelizing more integration with AI and machine learning with an anchor to deep learning using reinforcement learning.  There is some primitive integration with Tensorflow.
- Unity3D has steep learning curve from traditional development in that you have to master the 3D gaming environment prior to getting more productive
- Unity3D is at its core a physics, light, animation and simulation engine with an IDE; need to not just think of it as a "game engine" alone.
- Unity3D has a component system using "scripts" that implement Unity3D engine API using event hooks
- Unity3D started as OSX target and evolved to many more platforms
- Unity3D has some other capabilities in VR, AR, etc. that can be further explored and tracked
